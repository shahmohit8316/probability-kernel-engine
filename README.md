# 📊 Probability Kernel Engine

> **Zero-overhead, composable probability kernels for functional quant research and low-latency stochastic computation.**

---

## 🧠 Why

Modern trading, probabilistic inference, and kernel methods demand precise, composable primitives that scale **from theory to execution** — with **zero hidden abstractions**.  
This project is a **from-scratch OCaml engine** for building:
- 🧩 Modular probability kernels
- ⚡ High-performance stochastic process simulation
- 📐 Rigorous type-level guarantees
- 🧬 Extensible submodules for types, core logic, and correctness checkers

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Pure OCaml**, no runtime surprises.
- **Dune-powered**, reproducible builds.
- Inspired by **Grossman-Miller**, **Kyle**, and real microstructure theory.
- Ready for integration with **real-time trading engines** or **probabilistic inference pipelines**.

## ✨ Core Concepts

| Concept | What It Does |
|---------|----------------|
| **Axiom1** | Basic building blocks: measures, sigma-algebras, distributions |
| **Axiom2** | The main kernel engine: compose, transform, map kernels |
| **Types** | Strong types to enforce valid transitions, states, and probability measures |
| **Utils** | Functional helpers for kernel chaining, transformations |
| **Checker** | Mathematical correctness: ensures probability measures sum to 1, no leaks |
| **Axiom3** | Sandbox for research extensions: coupling kernels, non-standard priors |
